        <!-- Plagiarism Section -->
        <section id="plagiarism">
            <h2>Article: Plagiarism</h2>
            <p>   plagiarism is defined as the unethical appropriation of another author's ideas or expressions without proper attribution. It is considered a serious offense across various fields, often equated to theft of intellectual property. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as the wrongful appropriation of someone else's ideas or expressions. In India, plagiarism often arises from a lack of awareness, leading to unintentional offenses, especially among students who may not fully understand the implications of using others' work without citation.
                
Plagiarism is prevalent in educational institutions, where copying assignments or ideas from peers or online sources is common. This habit can hinder students' learning and lead to severe repercussions, including failing grades, academic probation, and even expulsion. Consequences can affect a student's future academic and professional reputation.
To prevent plagiarism, it is essential to practice proper citation and acknowledge sources used in research. Techniques like quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing can help incorporate others' ideas ethically. Promoting good writing practices and understanding the importance of academic integrity is crucial for students, as avoiding plagiarism not only fosters respect but also enhances their learning experience.

            <p>VIRUSES
A virus is a malicious program capable of infecting your files or your computer. It can result in different kinds of malfunction, hard drive erasure, etc.
To avoid contamination protect your computer by installing anti-virus software and updating it regularly. Never open an email attachment whose provenance or reliability you are not sure of. Sciences Po’s Information Systems Office has installed anti-virus software on all campus terminals, and regularly updates it. </p>
<p>SPAM
Spam is an unsolicited email sent to a large number of recipients without their prior agreement. Some are just pranks, others are more malicious—attempts to acquire your banking information, for example (in which case it’s called “phishing”, see below).
